/* TODO: handle [[ expr ]] bashism bash-compatibly.
 * [[ ]] is meant to be a "better [ ]", with less weird syntax
 * and without the risk of variables and quoted strings misinterpreted
 * as operators.
 * This will require support from shells - we need to know quote status
 * of each parameter (see below).
 *
 * Word splitting and pathname expansion should NOT be performed:
 *      # a="a b"; [[ $a = "a b" ]] && echo YES
 *      YES
 *      # [[ /bin/m* ]] && echo YES
 *      YES
 *
 * =~ should do regexp match
 * = and == should do pattern match against right side:
 *      # [[ *a* == bab ]] && echo YES
 *      # [[ bab == *a* ]] && echo YES
 *      YES
 * != does the negated == (i.e., also with pattern matching).
 * Pattern matching is quotation-sensitive:
 *      # [[ bab == "b"a* ]] && echo YES
 *      YES
 *      # [[ bab == b"a*" ]] && echo YES
 *
 * Conditional operators such as -f must be unquoted literals to be recognized:
 *      # [[ -e /bin ]] && echo YES
 *      YES
 *      # [[ '-e' /bin ]] && echo YES
 *      bash: conditional binary operator expected...
 *      # A='-e'; [[ $A /bin ]] && echo YES
 *      bash: conditional binary operator expected...
 *
 * || and && should work as -o and -a work in [ ]
 * -a and -o aren't recognized (&& and || are to be used instead)
 * ( and ) do not need to be quoted unlike in [ ]:
 *      # [[ ( abc ) && '' ]] && echo YES
 *      # [[ ( abc ) || '' ]] && echo YES
 *      YES
 *      # [[ ( abc ) -o '' ]] && echo YES
 *      bash: syntax error in conditional expression...
 *
 * Apart from the above, [[ expr ]] should work as [ expr ]
